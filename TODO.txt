Now I want to implement expenses feature.

there will be different types of expense.
1) Utility bill (Current bill, Gas Bill,)-> I would able to add different type of bill name as object.
2) I will make a model Staff. there will role Staff. (Waiter, Chef, Assistant Chef). Role will be different model. so that I can make role anytime.(For staff I want create a new djago app)
3) Another expense type is for a restaurant they need to buy raw material some product weight calculate in kg. some product in litter. Some product in per quantity price so we need to handle it.
4) We will calculate total 3 types of expense .-> 1) Utility bill, 2) Raw material 3) Staff salary. And last one is Others expenses. So I will implement it step by step.
